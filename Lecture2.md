## Initial Value Problems
* y' = f(y, x)
  * y<sub>0</sub> = y(x<sub>0</sub>)
  * x = independent variable
  * y = unknown function
  * f(y, x) = expression involving x and y
## Interval of Existence
* Question: What is the domain of a solution to an ODE?
* Fact: This domain must be on interval (possibly (-inf, inf) on (-inf, 3)) because y(x) is differentiable, therefore continuous
* Definition: We call the *interval of existence* the longest interval on which a solution y(x) to an ODE (or to an IVP) is defined
* Example: y' = y/x + xsinx f(y,x)
  * The general solution is y(x) = Cx - xcosx for any constant C
  * What is the interval of existence of y(x) = 3x - xcosx? 
    * Answer: (-inf, inf). This is the same for any value of C.
