### Show that [equation] is a solution of differential equation, initial value
1. Given y(t) = exp1 and y' = exp2.
2. Plug exp1 into equation for y'
3. Find derivative of exp1, verify it is the same as the expression resulting from step 2
4. Verify initial value satisfies y(t), if applicable
5. Interval of existence is longest defined interval containing the given t value
