# Midterm 1 Notes
## Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems - Polking (2nd Ed.)
## Section 2.1: First-Order Equations
### Show that [equation] is a solution of differential equation, initial value
1. Given y(t) = exp1 and y' = exp2.
2. Plug exp1 into equation for y'
3. Find derivative of exp1, verify it is the same as the expression resulting from step 2
4. Verify initial value satisfies y(t), if applicable
5. Interval of existence is longest defined interval containing the given t value
## Section 2.2: Seperable Functions
* F(x,y) is seperable if it can be expressed as a product of x's and y's
### Solving Seperable Differential Equations
1. Remember: y' means dy/dx. Get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by dx.
2. Get x's on one side, y's on the other
3. Integrate y side w.r.t. dy
4. Integrate x side w.r.t. dx
5. Solve for y to get an explicit solution. If not possible, get an implicit solution.
