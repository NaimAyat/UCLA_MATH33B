## Differential Equations
* Equations with an unknown; the unknown is a function
* Both the function and its derivatives appear in the equation
* Example: f = f' has the solution f(x) = Ce<sup>x</sup> for any real number constant C

**Definition**: *Ordinary differential equations (ODE)* are equations involving an unknown function and its derivatives. f(x) is the unknown function, x is the independent variable.

**Definition**: We call the order of an ODE "the highest derivative that appears". For example, f'' = f has order 2. Hyperbolic sin and hyperbolic cos are solutions.

* f = f(x) will always be a function mapping from fI -> R, where I is an interval

**Definition**: To get the *normal form of an ODE*, algebraically solve for the highest derivative.
